        <h2>Causes of Air Pollution</h2>
        <p><span class="design">Air pollution is caused by a variety of natural and anthropogenic (human-made) sources. Here are some common causes of air pollution:</span></p>
        <p><b><span class="highlight">1.Combustion of Fossil Fuels:</span></b>Burning fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, for energy production in power plants, industrial facilities, and vehicles releases pollutants like carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter into the air.</p>
        <p><b><span class="highlight">2.Vehicle Emissions:</span></b>Exhaust emissions from cars, trucks, motorcycles, and other vehicles are significant contributors to air pollution. These emissions contain pollutants like carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).</p>
        <p><b><span class="highlight">3.Industrial Processes:</span></b> Various industrial activities, such as manufacturing, chemical production, and metal processing, release pollutants into the air. These may include particulate matter, VOCs, sulfur compounds, and heavy metals.</p>
        <p><b><span class="highlight">4.Agricultural Activities:</span></b>Agricultural practices, including the use of fertilizers, pesticides, and the burning of crop residues, can release pollutants like ammonia (NH3) and particulate matter into the air.</p>
        <p><b><span class="highlight">5.Chemical Reactions in the Atmosphere:</span></b>Some air pollutants are formed through complex chemical reactions in the atmosphere. For example, ground-level ozone is produced through the reaction of precursor pollutants like nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight</p>
        <p><b><span class="highlight">6.Natural Sources:</span></b>Natural sources of air pollution include wildfires, volcanic eruptions, dust storms, and pollen. While these are natural processes, they can still contribute to localized air quality issues.</p>
        <p><b><span class="highlight">7.Household Activities:</span></b> Burning of solid fuels (wood, coal, biomass) for cooking and heating in households, especially in developing countries, can produce indoor and outdoor air pollutants.</p>
        <p><span class="design">Efforts to address air pollution typically involve regulatory measures, technological advancements, and public awareness campaigns to promote cleaner and more sustainable practices in various sectors.</span></p>
